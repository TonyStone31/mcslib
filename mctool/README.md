# Memory Card Server Explorer!

This really nifty tool will allow one to connect to a Memory Card Server to view
the stored blocks there, and allow the user to manipulate or subscribe to them.

If working with embedded systems or microservices, this tool can be extremely
useful when trying to debug or otherwise view the raw data structures being
stored.  It also allows easy updating of the block information as well.

With a subscription, when data is updated by another service using the block,
the changes will be automatically reflected in the viewer in this explorer
program.

The explorer also allows the easy exporting and importing of blocks from a
server.  This can be extremely useful to easily back-up a specific application
state, or to provide a pre-populated state for when moving from a staging to
a production environment.

Look forward to a full YouTube demonstration video showing off the full feature
set, which will be linked here when ready.
